## Introduction
Figaro is a probabilistic programming framework for the Scala programming language. It's designed to simplify the development of probabilistic models and to perform probabilistic inference in a straightforward and efficient manner. Figaro facilitates this by allowing developers to create and manipulate probabilistic models in a declarative way.

## Implementation

```Haskell
result = x `mod` y
```
